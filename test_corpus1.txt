6686:61	it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have --n404402 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled --n404439 that way.###.###i know my dad always talked about, uh,###he was in c c c during, uh,###.###yeah.###.###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing he could ever say --n403fb3 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###.###huh-uh.###.###because he was in it.###he thought that was great.###.###yeah.###.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.
7526:63	the elections where they have that topic --n402e25 seem --n402e30 to be a little bit better --n402e4f attended than some of the other ones.	###yeah.### that's, that's true.###i think in, uh, the texas governor elections, i think more people turned out --n402427 to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.###.###yeah,###well, that, uh,###mumblex i know that there's certain issues that --n4025e0 can really motivate people because we live in a pr-, pr-, predominately catholic type area,###.###oh, really.###.###and when things start, uh,### when, when abortion comes on the issues --n40282c and people just get all insp-, inspired, you know,###.###right.###.###and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh,###this particular community is a catholic community###but, uh, uh, down in d c where, where things are a little bit different --n402ad0, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and the, and that sort of movement,###and so it's, uh, quite the opposite,###so elections start --n402d99 getting very, uh,
8866:65	and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them --n400448, knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang --n400477 on the wall --n40048a to put a mirror on --n4004a5	###.###yeah.###.###all right.###.###all right.###well, nice talking to you.###.###nice talking to you.### have a good time.###.###all right.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###i guess, um, i'm going to school while i'm working at t i,###so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got --n400141, uh, for hobbies it seems like --n400168 lately.###but one of the things that i do --n400281 when i've got some spare time --n4002a4 is i do some woodworking.
9106:85	do you, uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai-, acid rain and some of the pollutants that --n400526 come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on.	### have a good time.###.###okay.###bye.###.###bye.###.###.###uh, robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think --n400056 are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution.###.###um, gee,###i don't##, i mean, i, i guess it's the stuff that --n400232 comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,###they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.###.###right.###.###so, i believe them###but i'm not a chemist.###.
9501:60	i, i think, in, in some, in some respects it probably mumblex more tolerable.	###speakera50-1*t50-1.###yeah.###speakerbnan*t50-1.###speakerb50-2*t50-2.###uh it doesn't,###some people say, uh, they, they like --n40369a to watch the changing of the seasons###speakeranan*t50-2.###.###but, uh, i'd rather, you know, like southern california, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.###.###yeah.###.###speakerb53-1*t53-1.###so, it's kind of a luxury.###speakeranan*t53-1.###speakera53-2*t53-2.###i tend --n403957 to agree###but, i don't know,###speakerbnan*t53-2.###speakera54-1*t54-1.
9507:75	well i guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten --n403bf7.	###speakeranan*t50-2.###.###but, uh, i'd rather, you know, like southern california, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.###.###yeah.###.###speakerb53-1*t53-1.###so, it's kind of a luxury.###speakeranan*t53-1.###speakera53-2*t53-2.###i tend --n403957 to agree###but, i don't know,###speakerbnan*t53-2.###speakera54-1*t54-1.### i, i think, in, in some, in some respects it probably mumblex more tolerable.###speakerbnan*t54-1.###speakerb54-2*t54-2.###yeah,###speakeranan*t54-2.###speakerb55-1*t55-1.
9584:73	when i, when i started --n400cb0 thinking about this --n400cc3, that those are some of my favorite shows,	###.###and i've, i've always liked that show probably the very best.###.###uh-huh.###i think i've actually seen a number of star treks, one way or another over the years. uh, although i never watched it regularly.###i'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then i've seen some of the star trek movies.###.###yeah,###those,###the movies are good too.###.###.###and i, i guess all, most of the shows i like --n400ae2 are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure.###.###uh-huh.###.
10235:39	unfortunately the rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.	### to sign him again,###yeah.###huh.###.###yeah,###that, you know, may or may not happen.###.###yeah,###oh you never know.###.###that's right,###it's a long way away.###.###that's sure ri-,###if you offer them money, i'm sure they'll, they'll do a little bit of everything.###.###that's right.###.###.###that's right,

11233:53	you know that was one thing we noticed --n402a90 last week that we had some new people move into our building and, you know, the nice cardboard boxes that you move, packing boxes. and they were just used --n402b1b one time and thrown --n402b32 in the dumpster	###.###well that's a neat idea.###.###well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, i think --n40257b.###i,###not by much,###but it does defray it some.###.###right.###.###enough to make it --n40272a worth our while to have several bins through out the building.###.###well that's, that's really good,###i mean at least they're trying.###.###yeah.###.###yeah###i know a lot of companies that --n40296f waste so much that,###i'm even trying,
